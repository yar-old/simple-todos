# Simple Todos

To-do list application using Meteor and React. To use, make sure you have Meteor installed first: type `meteor --version` in terminal.
If Meteor is installed, you should get a response similar to this: `Meteor 1.3.2.4`.

If you do not have Meteor installed, then [download it here](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Then, once you've downloaded this project to your desired directory, `cd` into the project directory and run `meteor npm install`. After
that is completed, run `meteor` to start the application.

Terminal should say something like: `App running at: http://localhost:3000/`â€”in which case, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your
browser to view the application.
